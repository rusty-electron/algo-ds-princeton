## Week 1

### Social network connectivity:

Given a social network containing `n` members and a log file containing `m` timestamps at which times pairs of members formed friendships, design an algorithm to determine the earliest time at which all members are connected (i.e., every member is a friend of a friend of a friend ... of a friend). Assume that the log file is sorted by timestamp and that friendship is an equivalence relation. The running time of your algorithm should be `mlogn` or better and use extra space proportional to `n`.

> This can be done using our already implemented weighted quick union algorithm, we need to create an array to keep track of the number of elements in each tree. When we perform a union operation of two trees the size of the merged tree should be updated. This way if we find that the size of a tree after a union operation is equal to `n` (total number of elements) then we can conclude that this tree is connected to all of the `n` members.

### Union-find with specific canonical element:

Add a method `find()` to the union-find data type so that `find(i)` returns the largest element in the connected component containing `i`. The operations, `union()`, `connected()`, and `find()` should all take logarithmic time or better.

For example, if one of the connected components is `{1,2,6,9}`, then the `find()` method should return 9 for each of the four elements in the connected components.
        
> Soluton: We need to create an extra array, `max_val[N]` for storing max values corresponding to the roots of each of the trees. First, we initialize this array with the values of elements themselves and then everytime we connect a root of a tree to another root, we consult this array of max values and update the `max_val[root(larger tree)]` to the larger among `max_val[root of p]` and `max_val[root of q]`.
